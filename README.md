In addition to the power-on message, the code was also changed in two places.
However, I can't comment on the effects.
My guess is that the changes fixed any bugs.

I've disassembled the code and edited it so that it can now be reassembled.
I've also added comments to the source code in a few places.

At this point I would like to point out that I have not examined the commands further.
The point here is not to describe the functions or procedures
I just want to present the source code I created from the modules.

The source code was created based on the COMAL80 module software, which is available on the Internet.<br />
The created files with this source code were compared by me with the existing data and correspond to this 1:1
